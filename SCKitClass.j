    This class is defined to make it easier to find the bundle,
    for example to get an image from the framework like this:

    @code
    var path = [[CPBundle bundleForClass:SCKit] pathForResource:@"email-action.png"];
    @endcode

    You can also use [SCKit version] to get the current version.
